# Level 5

## Objective
The Unicorn Raft has gotten a... fence? A laser fence? Guarded by laser turrets? Well this is just not realistic...

## Solution
This level has a laser fence and a laser turret that kill you INSTANTLY when you run into them. The only way I know how to
deal with this level immediately is to look at the game in dnSpy, again. We Open up the code in dnSpy and we find the `Laser
Turret` class. Inside, we find a collision method called `OnTriggerEnter` and inside we can see it looks for the player,
and will fire the lazer, if it is the player triggering this method call. If we replace that with a stub, we can jump through,
no problem!

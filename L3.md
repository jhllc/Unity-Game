# Level 3

## Objective
The Unicorn Raft is back! This time it has a shield. Well this one is not as straight forward...

## Solution
For this level, we just need to search for the health and ammo, again, and lock them. We can then walk and sprint around 
the unicorn, and shoot while doing it. If you get in at the sides, you will be able to shoot him. Alternatively, you could 
look for the rotation of the Unicorn Raft and lock it, but, I was unable to find it. I might have just not tried enough.

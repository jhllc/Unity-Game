# Level 6

## Objective
There is a guardian protecting the exit. It wants a fish, but you only have.. apple?

## Solution
Another level where we need to modify the running code. Luckily eveything is in plaintext, due to how CSharp works, but
in the future, we will have to combine the skills from all of these levels to find the code we actually want.

In this level, we just need to open up the `HasFish` class. We see this if statement here.

<br/>
If we click on the if statement and right click and hit `Edit IL Instructions...` we will get the IL instructions that make
up the if statement, and then the branch (Which branches to line 75 if the check is equal to 0). We want to right click the
code, and hit the `nop instructions` or hit `N` on the keyboard. If you did it right, it will nop the selected instructions
and you can restart the game and pass through, no issue!

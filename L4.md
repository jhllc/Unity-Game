# Level 4

## Objective
The Unicorn Raft has given up... Now he is just going to GIVE you the flag... or is he?

## Solution
In this level, I found two ways to approach it. We could modify the game inside of DNSpy. One of the classes in the game
dll is called "Pitfall", and this happens to be the code for this level. We can keep the ground from dropping by changing 
the arguments to this function

We need to change `ldc.l4.0` in both method calls to `ldc.l4.1`.

The world no longer falls when we enter the arena, and you can walk to the exit and get the flag.

The hard way, and possibly the intended way, would be to search for your Z axis value, or whatever axis the game engine 
uses to determine height. To do this, we need to fall down the world, and use the stairs to scan for an increase or decreased
value. Let's just assume that the value is increasing as we go up. We can start the map at the regular height. Do our first
scan for an initial unknown value, and then drop the floor, scan for a decreased value at the bottom of the steps and then 
search for an increased value as we climb the steps. I ended up with a few values, like 25 or so, and just added them all
to the address list. I then locked all of them, and walked off the stairs. My character started moving up and down, like 
it was stuck on something. I then turned off individual addresses at the bottom until I found the one that controlled 
the height, directly. I then put that value to 2 and walked over to the exit, where the flag had spawned!
